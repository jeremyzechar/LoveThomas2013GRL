Declustered NEIC list from Andy Michael. The other data are available publicly.

The solar-wind velocity data (omni_01_av.dat) are somewhat (but not overly) complicated, so Jeffrey encourages these to be downloaded, along with documentation, from the source at NASA: http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/ow.html

Monthly sunspot group number are attached "non-group-num". 

The AA data are also attached "dayave".
